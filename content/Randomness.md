# Chapter 1: Introduction to Randomness

Randomness is everywhere in nature and plays a vital role in creating unpredictable and lifelike behaviors. From the chaotic flutter of a butterfly's wings to the random distribution of stars in the sky, randomness gives the world its dynamic nature. In this chapter, weâ€™ll explore how to use randomness as a powerful tool in simulations, animations, and generative design.

Randomness can be thought of as the absence of a pattern or predictable order. However, in computer programming, randomness is not truly random but is instead *pseudorandom*. Computers use algorithms to generate sequences of numbers that appear random but are based on a deterministic process.

When working with randomness in code, it becomes an essential ingredient for:

- Creating natural-looking motion, like the swaying of leaves or the wobble of a falling object.
- Introducing variability into simulations, like population growth or particle systems.
- Adding creative flair to procedural generation, such as generating terrain, artwork, or even music.

This chapter covers the basics of randomness and is basically a way of the author to make you familiar with the programming and brush up on some simple code.

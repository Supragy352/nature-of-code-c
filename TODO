 Levy Flight:
   ☐ Large Steps
   ☐ Custom Distribuion
     ☐ Pick a random number: r1.
     ☐ Compute a probability p that r1 should qualify. Let’s try: p = r1. 
     ☐ Pick another random number: r2.
     ☐ If r2 is less than p, you’ve found your number: r1
     ☐ If r2 isn’t less than p, go back to step 1 and start over
